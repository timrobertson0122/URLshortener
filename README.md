# URLshortener

We'd like you to create a URL shortening service. 
- It should have a route where you can send a POST request with a URL body, which returns a short URL. 
- When you send a GET request to the returned URL, it should redirect to the POSTed URL. 
- We'd also like a simple frontend that can create and display shortened URLs without reloading the page. 
- For simplicity, don't worry about persisting the URLs between restarts  (ie, we don't need it to talk to an external database).
